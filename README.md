# Synopsys R&D Internship Application – Ashok Venna


## Why I Am a Good Fit
I am a 2025 B.Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from RGUKT University (CGPA: 8.1).  
My academic background and projects showcase a strong foundation in **Digital Design, Computer Architecture, and RTL development**, which align directly with Synopsys R&D’s engineering work.

I have practical experience in **C, Verilog, and SystemVerilog**, with hands-on projects involving processor design, hardware verification, and FPGA prototyping.  
I am passionate about building efficient, high-quality designs and contributing to impactful semiconductor R&D.
